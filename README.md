# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains custom implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C. It is intended for learning, experimentation, and as a reference for anyone interested in understanding the inner workings of common data structures and algorithms.

## Features
  - Linked List
  - Stack
  - Queue
  - Trees
  - Hash Table

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any C compiler

### How to compile and run

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/guidopastorino/dsa-implementations.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory of the specific implementation:

    ```bash
    cd <dsa-implementation>
    ```

3. To compile using the Makefile (recommended), simply run:
    ```
    make
    ```
    This will automatically compile the necessary C files.

4. If you prefer to compile manually using GCC, use the following command (replacing filename.c with the name of the C file you wish to compile):

    ```
    gcc -o output filename.c
    ```

5. Run the compiled program:

    ```
    ./program
    ```
